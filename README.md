A classic number guessing game, fully refactored for modern web development. This project demonstrates best practices in vanilla JavaScript, including robust game logic, a clean user interface, and an excellent user experience. It serves as a great example of how to structure a DOM manipulation project cleanly and efficiently.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Bug-Free Logic:** Correctly handles all 10 guesses, provides feedback on the final guess, and resets the game state flawlessly.
* **Enhanced User Experience:**
    * **On-Page Messaging:** Replaces disruptive `alert()` popups with styled, contextual messages for hints, success, and errors.
    * **Input Validation:** Checks for valid numbers, range (1-100), and **duplicate guesses**.
    * **Auto-Focus:** The input field is automatically focused for a smoother gameplay flow.
* **Refactored JavaScript:**
    * Code is wrapped in a `DOMContentLoaded` listener to ensure the DOM is ready before the script runs.
    * Clear separation of concerns with functions like `initGame`, `handleGuess`, and `updateUI`.
    * Robust state management without polluting the global namespace.
* **Modern & Responsive CSS:**
    * A clean, minimalist UI that works on all screen sizes.
    * Uses CSS variables (`:root`) for an easily themable color palette.

## ðŸ§  Code Structure

The JavaScript is organized into logical functions to manage the game flow and state:

* **`initGame()`**: Initializes or resets all game state variables (random number, attempts, etc.) and UI elements to their default state.
* **`handleGuess()`**: The main function triggered on submit. It validates user input, processes the guess, and checks if the game is won or over.
* **`displayMessage()`**: A helper function to show styled feedback to the user (e.g., success, warning, or danger messages).
* **`updateUI()`**: Updates dynamic parts of the UI, such as the list of previous guesses and the remaining attempts counter.
* **`endGame()`**: Disables the input fields and displays the "Start New Game" button when the game is over.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the game.
* **CSS3**: For all styling, including:
    * Flexbox for layout.
    * CSS Variables for theming.
    * Responsive design principles.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: For all game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
